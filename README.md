The Moodify app lets the user connect to their Spotify account and have a playlist generated for them based on a given genre, obscurity and length inputs. These are all factored into calls to the Spotify API. The user can remove songs from the suggested playlist and then save it to their Spotify account.

This was done as a group final project for Mobile App 438S FL23.
